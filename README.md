# Project 1 - *Flicks App*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [X] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [X] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [X] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. What is a better way of implementing a network error? 
2. Is is possible to switch between a table view and grid view?

## Notes

One major challenge that I encountered while creating this app was figuring out how to implement the search bar. Even though I a general guideline, the problem arose when I was trying to implement how the search processed the text that was entered. One minor problem I had was figuring out how to implement a network error. I eventually got it working by using a UIView.
